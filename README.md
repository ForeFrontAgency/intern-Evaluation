In order to complete an exercise, we will have to create what's called a pull request. To do this, we will need a fork of this repository. A fork is our own copy of this repository. To create a fork, click the "Fork" button in the top right of the page.

After the fork is complete, you will find a copy of this repository under your profile. For example, the URL will be https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/intern-Evaluation.

When we complete exercises, we will do it in our fork, and then request that those changes be merged into the original copy of the "intern-Evaluation" repository. When our completed exercises are merged back into the  repository.
